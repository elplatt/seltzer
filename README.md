## Overview ##
Seltzer CRM is a tool for managing membership data at hackerspaces and similar
membership organizations.  It is designed to be useful to a typical hackerspace
administrator without any training, and easy to tailor to the needs of a
particular space through modularity rather than modification or configuration.

The current features are:
* Tracking of member contact and emergency contact info
* Tracking of membership levels and dates
* Automated Billing
* Amazon Payments and PayPal integration
* Tracking of RFID key assignments
* Track members' mentors
* Customizable permissions and roles

Why create another CRM?  There are a number of powerful CRMs out there already,
including the open source CiviCRM.  However, we found the complexity of existing
CRMs to be an obstacle to recruiting and training volunteers at member-run
organizations such as hackerspaces.  Seltzer CRM has a very basic feature set
tailored to the needs of a hackerspace.

Seltzer has been in production use at the i3 Detroit hackerspace in Ferndale, MI
since 2010-12-20.
