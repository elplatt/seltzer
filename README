1. OVERVIEW
===========
Seltzer CRM is a tool for managing membership data at hackerspaces and similar
membership organizations.  It is designed to be useful to a typical hackerspace
administrator without any training, and easy to tailor to the needs of a
particular space (through modularity rather than forking or configuration).

The current features are:
* Tracking of member contact and emergency contact info
* Tracking of membership levels and dates
* Tracking of voting status
* Tracking of key assignments
* Customizable permissions and roles

Seltzer has been in production use at the i3 Detroit hackerspace in Ferndale, MI
since 2010-12-20.

2. WHY CREATE ANOTHER CRM?
==========================
There are a number of powerful CRMs out there already, including the open source
CiviCRM.  However, we found the complexity of existing CRMs to be an obstacle
to recruiting and training volunteers at member-run organizations such as
hackerspaces.  Seltzer CRM has a very basic feature set tailored to the needs
of a hackerspace.

3. HOW TO INSTALL
=================
Check out the INSTALL file.

4. BASIC USAGE
==============
NOTE: to preserve historical data, only delete plans, members, and key
assignments if they were created in error.  If a plan, member, or key
assignment is no longer valid, it should be marked as inactive rather than
deleted.

Add or edit different levels of membership plans by clicking the "Plans" tab.
This tab displays a list of existing plans.  Each existing plan has links to
edit or delete that plan.  You may add a new plan by clicking the "Add" sub-tab.

Add or edit members by clicking the "Members" tab.  This tab displays a list of
all members, past and present.  Members may be filtered down to only active
or voting members.  Each member has a link to edit or delete that member.  To
add a new member, click the "Add" sub-tab.

To manage a member's membership status, click a member, and then click the
"Plan" sub-tab.

To edit a member's roles (which determine their permissions) click a member and
then click the "Roles" sub-tab.

To manage a member's key assignments, click a member in the "Members" tab, then
click the "Keys" sub-tab.

To grant or revoke permissions for user roles, click the "Permissions" tab.

To import member data, click the "Members" tab, then click the "Import sub-tab.
You will need to upload a CSV file.  The first row should contain the following
headers:

* "First Name"
* "Middle Name"
* "Last Name"
* "Email"
* "Phone"
* "Emergency Name"
* "Emergency Phone"
* "Username" If blank, will use <first initial><last name>
* "Plan" The name of the plan to assign a member to.  If no plan of that name
  exists, it will be created.
* "Start Date" The date the user joined in YYYY-MM-DD format.

A user will be created for each subsequent row.
