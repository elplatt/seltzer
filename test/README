How to run the cucumber tests.

You don't necessarily have to run the tests on the same machine as the application,
but it might be a bit easier.

You'll need to have Ruby installed plus the following gems:
cucumber
watir
headless
mysql
rspec

If you're installing the mysql gem on linux, then you may also
have to install the following first:
sudo apt-get install libmysql-ruby
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

Once you have Seltzer up and running. Edit the test configuration file at:
    test/features/support/test_config.yml

Change the following values to match your Seltzer installation
      base_url: http://localhost/crm/
      mysql:
          host: localhost
          database: seltzerdb
          username: crm
          password: crm

Now, from the 'test' directory, you should be able to run the tests like so:

  cucumber

Note that a couple tests require input from the tester.
These are tagged with the @manual tag for your convenience.
For unattended operation, exclude the manual tests like so:

  cucumber --tags ~@manual
